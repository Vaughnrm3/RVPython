# RVPython
**Python Code**

**Key Questions:**
- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- What times of the day do people spend the most money?
- How can we simplify price range groupings?
- What are the most popular products and departments?
- What kinds of customers are buying our products (age, income, region, loyalty, ordering habits, etc?)
-How frequently do customers use Instacart?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for the purpose of this assignment.
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?
Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences are therein ordering habits of different customer profiles (price, frequency, quantity)?
